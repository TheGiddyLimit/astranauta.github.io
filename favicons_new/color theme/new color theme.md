### Unified Color Theme
In rejiggering the icons, I started to put together a more cohesive color theme. It could also work for the site, if Giddy wants to do that, but for now I'm proud of it and want to show off.

- **Adventure Blue #006BC4** This is the color of the site's header in Day Mode, and so considered as the "official" color of the site. As such, it's the background color of the "app icon" design.
- **Gelatinous Cube #1998FF** More bright than Adventure Blue
- **Barovian Midnight #004278** A beautiful darker shade of Adventure Blue.
- #AF415E - A beautiful red that fits well. Don't know where to use this just yet.

  - Dark and Stormy night - a dark grey?
  - Dragon blue: a darker one, like a darker shade of electric blue
  - Slaad blue: a more vibrant one than "official". ![blue slaad](https://5e.tools/img/bestiary/MM/Blue%20Slaad.jpg?v=1.114.1)
